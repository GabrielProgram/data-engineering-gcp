Finished:
- [Google Cloud profesional data engineer certification](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-gcp-professional-data-engineer-certification/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24A) - suitable for newbiews, it's more GCP tools overview with practice than real deep dive comparisons for exam preparation. Overall not bad.
